# ðŸ’³ Corporate Pass Booking System
This project was done in collaboration with Singapore Sports School. The organisation needed a system which facilitated the currently manual process of booking corporate membership passes to attractions managed by the Mandai Wildlife Reserve. 

The application caters to three users: 

- Staff: Allows them to check which corporate passes are available to be booked on a specific date, for a specific attraction
- Admin: Manage users and passes on the application. They are able to disable lost cards and place a ban on users who lost their card so that they are unable to access the system until they have paid a penalty.
- General Office Personnel: Mark passes as collected, returned, or lost.
